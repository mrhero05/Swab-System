# Swab System

The **Swab System** is a web-based application developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate the scheduling and management of doctor appointments. Built using **PHP**, **MySQL**, **jQuery**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**, this system provides an intuitive and efficient solution for users to request appointments while offering admins the ability to manage and assign doctors to specific appointments. Additionally, the system logs all appointment activities for transparency and easy tracking. One of its key features is the ability to generate a **COVID status report**, providing valuable insights into the pandemic situation at the facility.
